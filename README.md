Using Kiwi for Mac OS X Development
=============

Kiwi is an excellent unit-testing framwork for iOS and Mac. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a hassle to set up for the Mac and so I created this demo project with instructions.

I used CocoaPods (https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) to do this initial install with just a few changes to add the actual test file and change one build setting.

The setup instructions are now on the official Kiwi wiki: https://github.com/allending/Kiwi/wiki/Up-and-Running-with-Kiwi-for-Mac
